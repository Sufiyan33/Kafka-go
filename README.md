# Kafka-go
Apache Kafka is a open source & distributed data store that optimized for ingesting and processing streaming data in real time. Kafka operates based on a publish-subscribe model, where data is organized into topics. Producers publish data records to specific topics, and consumers subscribe to these topics to receive and process the data.

Overall, Kafka is primarily used to build real-time streaming data pipelines and applications that adapt to data streams. It combines messaging, storage, and stream processing to store historical and real-time data.
